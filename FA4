Scenario: 
-Me and my 4 friends want to track our weekly test scores across 3 subjects.

What the 2D Array Represents:
-Rows: Each person (me, friend 1, friend 2, friend 3, friend 4, friend 5)
-Columns: our weekly test scores in 3 subjects (Math, English, Science

Sample 2D Array:
scores = [
    [85, 88, 90],   # Me
    [78, 82, 80],   # Friend 1
    [92, 90, 94],   # Friend 2
    [88, 85, 87],   # Friend 3
    [80, 83, 79]    # Friend 4
]

print(scores[2][2])  #2 Lines of code that prints a specific value or updates it:
scores[0][1] = 90

I chose this data set because as a student of my own, i know its common between us to compare scores, even me and my friends do that, 2D arrays just happen to make it easier to do
The 2D array helps organize data by seperating people into rows and subjects into columns. Its easy to acess, update and compare rows because of this structure. Theres also functions
we can use in Pythton to simplify calculating averages and finding the highest scores.
