Short explanation:
-Using a 2D array made analyzing the data easier for me because all the test scores were organized in
one structure. Each row representing a person and each column representing a subject made it very easy
to perform operations and calculate totals averages per student. I found printing each row to be the easiest
in summarizing the data. Overall, using a 2D array to organize the test scores of me and my friends helped me 
compare them easier, faster and in a more organized manner.
